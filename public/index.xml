      <description>We have 1 object of worship: God in the Father, Son, and Spirit The Lord is the only one deserving of the worth and weight we ascribe through our worship.
We worship in 2 contexts: gathered and scattered For a Christian, all of live is worship to The Lord, through by the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of our worship to the Father, and empowered by the indwelling Holy Spirit, who stirs our affections to praise and reminds us daily of the grace of God.</description>

We value clarity and participation in our gathered worship  Songs should be sing-able Lyrics should be clear and discernible Choosing keys for congregational singing rather than making ourselves sound good  3.</description>
