Thank you for considering joining us as we seek to serve our gathered church in corporate worship!

There are many opportunities to use your gifts and interests in music, production arts, and in A/V technology. We want to make sure we get the chance to know you, and for you to know us, so that we can serve together effectively. 

Our process for this is described here:

### 1. Application
This application is how we begin to get to know you, your experience, and your interests. Please be honest, thorough, and as concise as possible. Your answers need not be exhaustive, but should accurately reflect your opinions and life-experiences. If at any point you do not have an opinion on a subject, simply note that.

### 2. Orientation
After we receive your application, we will schedule a team orientation for you. The orientation is how you get to know the teams you are interested in and their leaders. Much of the information you will learn is available in this guide, but the orientation will give you an opportunity to dig deeper and ask any questions you may have.

### 3. Audition
For music team applicants, the final step in joining the team is an informal audition to allow the team leaders to assess your ability on the instrument(s) with which you desire to serve. You will be asked to either sing/play along with one of the team leaders, or to video record a sample for review.

### 4. Scheduling
At the end of the process, we will have a discussion on how to proceed, either with scheduling to serve with a team, or next steps for growth and equipping before scheduling you.
