### Planning Center

We schedule and coordinate our music and production teams using the online tool, [Planning Center](https://www.planningcenteronline.com). Upon joining one of our teams, you will receive an initial welcome email from Planning Center inviting you to login, set a password, and update any contact information.

We use Planning Center to:

- Schedule our weekly serve teams.
- Send weekly reminders.
- Share the worship service plan.
- Share all music preparation resources.

*It is important to learn to use this tool effectively, as it is the lifeblood of our team communication.* Here are a few key tips for getting the most from Planning Center: 

### 1. Update Your Contact Info and Preferences
Planning Center has the ability to send you all communications by either email or SMS/text. Please make sure all of the information in Planning Center is updated, and your preferences are set so that you are notified with your preferred method.

### 2. Serve Team Requests 
As the serve team schedule is planned, the team leaders will send out "Request to Serve" messages using Planning Center. This may arrive as an email or SMS/text depending on your preferences.

When you receive a request, **please make sure to respond** by either "Accepting" or "Declining" the request(s).

If you receive requests for multiple weeks in a single message, you may have to first go to "My Schedule" in Planning Center to respond to individual weeks:

### 3. Blackout Dates
Planning Center has the ability to let you set black out dates for vacations or other weeks you know you will be away. Using these will help the team leaders schedule team members more effectively.
