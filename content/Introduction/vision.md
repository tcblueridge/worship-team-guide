### We have 1 object of worship: God in the Father, Son, and Spirit
The Lord is the only one deserving of the worth and weight we ascribe through our worship.

### We worship in 2 contexts: gathered and scattered
For a Christian, all of live is worship to The Lord, through by the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of our worship to the Father, and empowered by the indwelling Holy Spirit, who stirs our affections to praise and reminds us daily of the grace of God. 

Though all of life is worship, we also need to gather together in moments of worship in weekly fellowship to encourage and spur on one another to greater faithfulness, and to bear each otherâ€™s burdens. This weekly fellowship is vital to our lives as believers.

### Our worship has 3 audiences: God, the gathered church, and the unchurched
As the object of our worship, The Lord is the primary audience of our worship. All our worship through preaching the Word, singing, prayer, and fellowship are first and foremost to give Him glory.
A second audience of our worship is the gathered church. As we proclaim the glory of God and seek greater faithfulness, we are encouraging ourselves, and our brothers and sisters in Christ, to greater belief, faith, and obedience. This is true of our weekly moment of worship together, as well as how we live in our scattered worship throughout the week.

The unchurched and non-Christians are a final audience of our worship. Our faithfulness and struggles as we display and declare the gospel to others is a means by which the Lord draws the lost to Him.
