In light of our worship vision at The Church of Blue Ridge, we who serve our church in the ministry of worship hold to these values:

### 1.	We value the glory of God and faithfulness to Him above all else
  -	Disciples of Christ
  -	Faithful members of the church
  -	Faithful in Word and prayer

### 2.	We value clarity and participation in our gathered worship
  -	Songs should be sing-able
  -	Lyrics should be clear and discernible 
  -	Choosing keys for congregational singing rather than making ourselves sound good

### 3.	We value character over competency 
  -	How faithful we are in serving others is more important than how skilled we are in our craft.

### 4.	We value excellence in everything we do
  -	We strive to be prepared, skilled, and excellent in heart, mind, and spirit.	

### 5.	We value servanthood over stardom
  -	We are a relinquishing people.
  -	Leadership is for service, not status.
  -	We are undershepards in ministry to the people of TCBR
